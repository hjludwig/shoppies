## My submission for the Fall 2021 Shopify Frontend Developer intern challenge.

As per the brief, this app displays search results from the OMDb database (movies only) and allows users to select five movies to nominate.

Users can add and remove movies from their nomination list. When a movie is selected, it can't be added again, and when five movies have been selected, the user is alerted and no more movies can be added.

## Additional features

In addition to the basic requirements, I improved the design and added animations for the loading state and the adding of nominations.
